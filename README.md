This was a pair project in Module 4 at Turing School of Software & Design. The project description can be found here: [Project Outline](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

## Project Description

Our goal for this project was to build a game that is playable in the browser. There is no server-side component for this project. We used client-side JavaScript to complete this project. Our game, Beatbox, is a spin-off of Guitar Hero and Tap Tap Revenge.

## Learning Goals

* Use client-side to drive both the design and implementation of code
* Use jQuery to traverse and manipulate the DOM
* Use test-driven design to build a client-side application


##  Game Time Starter Kit

We set up our repo with this starter kit.

To install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To fire up a development server:

```
npm start
```

Once the server is running, you can visit:

* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/` to run your application.
* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/test.html` to run your test suite in the browser.

To build the static files:

```js
npm build
```


To run tests in Node:

```js
npm test
```
